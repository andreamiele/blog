# Test Handbook


## About

Its content is inspired by a large number of sources, from which numerous ideas and several illustrations were borrowed (more details [here](./reference/acknowledgments.md)).

Demonstrations and challenges leverage the essential tools of the Python ecosystem for Machine Learning: [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org), [Keras](https://keras.io/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

## Usage

All chapters are written as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) combining explanations and example code. 

The content of this site is designed to be browsed thematically rather than sequentially.
